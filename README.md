# Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Network

This project implements a decentralized **Pharmaceutical Supply Chain** network using **Hyperledger Fabric**. The network includes four main organizations: **Manufacturers**, **Wholesalers**, **Pharmacies**, and **Regulators**, ensuring the secure, traceable, and transparent movement of drugs across the supply chain.

## Features

- **Manufacturer**:
  - Register new drugs with batch numbers and manufacturing details.
  - Update drug status during production and handoff to wholesalers.

- **Wholesaler**:
  - Track the movement of drug batches through the distribution network.
  - Update drug status during warehousing and transportation.

- **Pharmacy**:
  - Verify drug authenticity and record dispensing details.
  - Ensure drugs are stored and handled according to regulations before dispensing to consumers.

- **Regulator**:
  - Monitor drug flow and ensure compliance with safety and regulatory standards.
  - Approve and verify drug batches before they enter the market.
